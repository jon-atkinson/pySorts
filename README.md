# pySorts
Simple collection of sorts, getting back into python, will add testing framework and comparison system eventually. 

Not really feasible for actual use, more to see how python implementation of different data structures and memory allocation changes the performance of each of the implemented sorts. 

Also chose to do something the language isn't designed for to hopefully come up against more of the errors and be able to write intuitively python-styled code quicker. 

Possibility to extend-change this repo to run implementations of different sorting algos in different languages against each other over a series of synthetic tests, and have a unified frontend interface for visualisation - long way down the road for this though.
