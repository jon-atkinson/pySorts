# pySorts
Simple collection of sorts, getting back into python, will add testing framework and comparison system eventually. 

Not really feasible for actual use, more to see how python implementation of different data structur and mem allocation changes the performance of each of the implemented sorts. 

Also chose to do something the language isn't designed for to hopefully come up against more of the errors and be able to write intuitively python-styled code quicker.
